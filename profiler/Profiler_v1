# Profile for Pyleoclim (autoTS)

1. Evenly/unevenly spaced  - Done
2. Trend
Approach 1
  - use HHT -> threshold. If variance is below x, not a Trend
  - Pseudo-data with different trends and see when spectral methods would fail, set x at failure.
  - Detect linear vs nonlinear
Approach 2:
Use wwz, and look at high vs low frequency power
3. Gap detections
